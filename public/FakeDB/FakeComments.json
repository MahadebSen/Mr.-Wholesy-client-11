The purpose of this is so the person viewing the prototype has a chance to actually feel and understand the idea behind what you have created."

I have found that they are not always, um, shall we say, 'Timely' when it comes to supply me with the actual copy/content for the site. As you can imagine, I cannot just want around for them to give me the words that go on the page! I need to get moving and develop the site so they can see what it will look like."

Who do you know… who's allowed children to be murdered… hmm? Gus! He has, he has been ten steps ahead of me at every turn."
